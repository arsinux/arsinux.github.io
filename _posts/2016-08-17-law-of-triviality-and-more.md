[Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) simply says, don't dedicated your resources on trivial issues when you have so much important issues to work on. The thing is everyone might have an opinion on what the website's color schema should be and if you let them, they can expand this conversation until they want it to. But when it comes to which design architecture works best for our software, because less members know about its techniqal details it will pass much faster than the trivial issue. 

But sometimes the techniqal guys might also fall into this trap as well. They might think that something is consequential and it worth lots of time to decide about it, while it really might not be that consequential. [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) says in his [The Laracasts Snippet episode 34](https://laracasts.simplecast.fm/34) that "... all these code and all these techniques and these patterns and these ideas and architectures, they are fun to learn but at the end of the day its all about getting this thing you are working on out to the public. ... and every thing else is just a detail. ... the problem is we all have the ability to become so focused on the detail that we forget about the actual goal. ... Developers are very zoomed in. The more you zoom out the more those little details really don't matter at the end of the day. Whether I use Doctrine or ActiveRecord as one example is not going to effect whether or not my business makes money."

I am not saying that we completely should not care about the techniqal details, as Jeffery also said that "[Details doesn't matter until] assuming I can implement the exact same thing in the same amount of time" (which I guess as he knows it, time is not the only metric here and lots of other things like quality, risks and etc. matter), but it might be a good practive for us to consider the big picture.

I don't exactly know where the line is between a detail being trivial or consequential, but I think the important thing is to be **aware** of the fact that some details might be trivial to spend resources on.
