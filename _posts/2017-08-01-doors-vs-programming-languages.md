I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI) from Vox about doors and I was
introduced to [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman) (He has a famous book regarding this issue
I want to write about: [The Design of Everyday
Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things)). It came to my mind that we can do the
same thing as he did for doors, to APIs, Programming Languages, Technical Instructions and Documentations. I
remember Jeffery Way talking in his [podcast](https://laracasts.com/podcast) about how sometimes you can not
figure out how to work with some API or Programming Language and you think you are stupid but you are not. As
Don also says in this video, you are not dumb for not being able to know which way to open the doors only by
looking at it. In fact, the door has to be self representative. APIs, Programming Languages and Documentations
are also everyday things that we need to design well, so we have to follow Human-Centered design patterns
because the intention is for humans to use them. 

I remember blaming myself for constantly trying to run away from my tasks of working with some beta level development technologies and thinking that there is something wrong with me. But the important lesson for me is to be conscious about it. Consciously dealing with this issue, knowing that this is not you being dumb and there is a reason behind it, makes you handle your tasks easily. Because you then never say to yourself "Why can't I get this right!", and you instead say "I know it is hard to get because of it's design, I just have to be patient and try more". 

I don't want to say that designing doors to be self representative is not important, [in fact it is very
important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z14eZN7ZjA), but the cost of not getting it in the first place is
only getting it the second and it will never be the case that you say to yourself, now that I couldn't open the
door in my first try I give up. But when dealing with computers and technologies the options aren't only one
way or another, and this can lead to frustration and at the end to giving up. And we have to let people know that it can sometimes be hard to figure out something so that they don't give up and meanwhile we have to work on Human-centric design of our products.
