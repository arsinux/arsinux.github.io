Yesterday I had an oral AI exam at the university. The professor told me to consider a student dormitory manager who wants an AI application from you which can understand if the students put the right garbage into the right bin (use the sample data that the manager gives you from the students, and surveillance cameras). We talked about the AI environment characteristics for the problem classification for some minutes. And finally I told him as an AI designer how I want to design it. Then he asked me about the ethical issues. I told him that I will make my code open source so that everyone can see there are no back-door in my application which could be viciously used and I will not give or sell any information that I have in my databases. Then he said, **What about the dormitory manager!**

I guess it was natural for me not to consider that point because of the stress that I had for my first oral exam. But he was right, **a better answer would be first of all and before I care about the code privacy I have to check whether the manager has permission to do this or not ?**.

Lessons learned here for me was, us programmers not only must consider privacy in our code, but also must consider to whom we are developing that tool and whether they have permission to use that tool or not.
